# candidate-search

## Description

This app aims to create a candidate search simulation by importing a list of potential "candidates" from Github via their API, and display info for each candidate one at a time, allowing you to either reject the candidate immediately or save them to a potential candidates list before moving on to the next candidate.

Through this project, I primarily learned more about using React with Typescript, and got to practice my skills with React Router, Vite, local storage, and external API's that use tokens.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

Copy the SSH Key from the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dcartolano/react-portfolio) and perform a git clone into the directory of your choice. Open in VS Code or similar program. In the terminal, run "npm i" to download all relevant node modules.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

If you only want to navigate to the deployed site, you can view it [here](https://shiny-baklava-8ba7dd.netlify.app).

If you are trying to view the app locally through the terminal, right click on the package.json file in the outermost folder and select "Open in Integrated Terminal", then run the command "npm i" if you haven't already, followed by "npm run build" and finally "npm run start." It may not open in your browser automatically, so use a ctrl-click (for Windows) or a cmd-click (for mac) on the link shown in the terminal to open it in your default browser.

Thanks to EdX and Northwestern for the starter code and the opportunity to practice these skills. 

Thanks to my instructor and the EdX tutors for all the help and clarifications along the way.
